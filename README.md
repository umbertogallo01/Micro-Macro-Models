# Microscopic Dynamics and Linearized Euler Equations

This repository contains numerical implementations of microscopic models for social and physical systems, along with solvers for wave propagation and linearized Euler equations using Finite Volume methods.

## 1. Microscopic Models
Implementation of agent-based dynamics focusing on social interactions and transportation:
* **Opinion Dynamics**: Modeling interaction and compromise between agents to study consensus and cluster formation.
* **Vehicular Traffic**: Microscopic simulation of vehicle flow and interaction patterns, analyzing speed and density relationships.

## 2. Wave and Linearized Euler Equations
Numerical solution of hyperbolic systems focusing on conservation laws and flux approximations.
* **Linearized Euler Equations**: Implementation of solvers for the linearized system of gas dynamics.
* **Numerical Schemes**: Application of Finite Volume Methods (FVM).
* **Solvers**: Upwind and Rusanov (Local Lax-Friedrichs) schemes for numerical flux approximation.
* **Objective**: Analysis of wave propagation, stability, and the evolution of perturbations in linearized systems.
